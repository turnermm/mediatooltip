# mediatooltip
Creates enhanced media tooltips for Dokuwiki media.

This plugin was initially developed to create enhanced tooltips and image filenames for wikis that use images based on photographs. However it has been expanded for use with any media files. The tooltips are based on the jQuery tooltip widget, and their appearance can be controlled by making changes to the style.css file that is included in the plugin directory.
